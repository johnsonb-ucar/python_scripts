# Python Scripts
A collection of scripts for automating tasks. In general, these scripts are created to run on CISL resources such as Cheyenne and Casper.

## Best Practices
To ensure consistency and readability, these scripts:
 - Are written in Python 3.
 - Attempt to maintain backward compatibility with Python 2.
 - Are compliant with [Python Enhancement Protocol 8 (PEP-8)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
 - Only use Python's standard libraries (no external dependencies).
 - Have extensive comments geared toward readers who might be unfamiliar with Python.
